    "\n",
    "The two most common ways to iterate (or repeat) a set of commands are the _while loop_ and the _for loop_. That's why in Python the words `while`, `for` (and `in`) are reserved words and you can't use them for variable names. \n",
    "\n",
    "The video below is a nice (if slightly scary) intro to each of the approaches; you might remember them the next time you're in the gym:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'right' approach you use usually depends on [what sort of data structure you are iterating over](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/920645/when-to-use-while-or-the-for-in-python) and [whether we know before we start how many times we want to repeat the commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3bqzpf/python_for_loops_vs_while_loops/). That might sound a little vague at this point, but come back and have a think about it once you have a better understanding of how loops work.\n",

If the condition is `True` then it runs the remainder of the *indented* code block following the `if`. The 'true' block of code is only run once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `while` statement, the 'true' block is run for as long as the condition evalutes to `True`. So if the statment continues to evaluation to `True` then the block of code is run again and again and again and again... and again until some stopping condition is reached (usually the while condition becomes `False` for 'some reason').\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a deeper look:\n",
    "- First, we defined a variable `counter` and we _initialised_ it with a value of 1. \n",
    "- Then we used the `while` statement to check if the value of `counter` was less than or equal to 10. \n",
    "- Since that condition evaluated to `True`, we printed the value of `counter` and then added 1 to the `counter`. \n",
    "- The indendented block of code was then run again and again by Python *until* the `while` statement returned a `False` (this happened because the value of counter went all the way to 11).\n",
    "- After that Python simply continued to execute the code outside the `while` *block* (i.e. the last line of non-indented code)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea is thus: *while this condition holds, repeat the instructions in the indented code block*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many beginner programmers get confused by the fact that the value of `counter` is increasing without the code advancing to the point where in prints out 'The while loop has ended'. Remeber: we are starting the instruction from the beginning of the *while block*. So the first time that we hit it, `counter` has value of 1 because this is what we set it to _outside_ of the *while loop*. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the _second_ time the while conditional is evaluted, `counter` has been incremented to 2 because the last line of the `while` block is `counter += 1`! So we increased its value while inside the *while block*. At the beginning of the third iteration it will have a value of 3, while at its end it will be incremented to 4. And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "_CAVEAT_: pay attention to how you write your `while` *loops*! They can potentially run forever (for as long as the condition they are evaluating is `True`) maxing out your machine's memory. For example:\n",

In fact, if you remove the `break` then you will crash jupyter because the computer will print out every even number to infinity (which the computer canâ€™t handle because it runs out of memory).\n",

    "    ... do something with odd numbers...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    ... do something else with even numbers...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'Inside' the odd numbers section we now have a second `if`/`else` block:\n",
    "```if i == 9:\n",
    "    ... do something if the odd number is 9...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    ... do something else if the odd number is not 9...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. And itâ€™s a _similar_ story in the even numbers section:\n",
    "```if i % 4 == 0:\n",
    "    ... do something if the even number is divisible by 4...\n",
    "elif i == 8\n",
    "    ... do something else if the even number is 8...\n",
    "```\n",
    "We'll not give you the answer to how to print out `WOOT` in place of 7 below, but at this point you all the clues you need. Itâ€™s the concept that is the hard part and following whatâ€™s going on when you start to nest conditions inside of conditions.

We'll `break` out of the loop after hitting the 21<sup>st</sup> iteration.\n",
