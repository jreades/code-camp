Dear Masters Students

First, congratulations on your admission to [CASA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/'), the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at UCL. We look forward to meeting you in-person soon!

This email is intended for those of you who have **never programmed before** or who have **not programmed recently**. We want to help you **do better on assessments and get more out of your degree**.

### WHAT IS CODE CAMP?

Code Camp is a short introduction to the basics of programming in Python that you take at your own pace. There are no tests or extra credit for completing Code Camp, but **the more you do, the better you will do in your classes**. 

You can do the lessons whenever you like, but we would strongly recommend *not* doing them the day before the start of term. Like driving a car, performing brain surgery, and speaking Russian (one of us tried as an undergrad), learning to code takes time. Indeed, **learning to code is like a learning a language**, and it‚Äôs a lot easier if you practice regularly. Starting now.

### ACCESSING CODE CAMP

Code Camp is accessed through a micro-site at:

[**https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/**](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/)

All of the code on the web site can be run directly in your browser, or copied and pasted into your programming 'tool of choice' (more on this in a moment).

### RUNNING CODE CAMP

There are two main options for running the Python code included in Code Camp. These are both covered in the [Setting Up](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/setup/) section of the [Code Camp micro-site](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/) as well, but below are direct instructions for getting started.

#### OPTION 1. IN THE CLOUD

In this case there is **nothing to install on your computer**. So if your only free time for coding is on a commute, you can *even* do this on a tablet or phone. 

How to get started:

1. Start any of the lessons on the [microsite](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/) that involve coding and you will see a notice a message underneath the lesson title saying that 'Pyodide' is initialising.
2. Once the status of Pyodide changes to 'Ready' any of the code on that page can be run in your browser just by clicking the 'Play' (‚ñ∫) button. 
3. You can also edit any of the code that you see so that you can experiment and test your understanding.

#### OPTION 2. RUNNING LOCALLY

If you don't want to (or can't) run the code in your browser, then you can follow the [Installing Python options](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/setup/install.html) to select an appropriate 'Python distribution'.

You will also want a place to save and edit the Python code *before* you paste it into the Python interpreter. We would suggest [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as it's free and open source. But any text editor will do, and on a Windows machine you can also use Notepad/Notepad++.

Once you've installed VS Code, you just create a new file, paste the code from the micro-site into the file (copying can be done by clicking on the 'Clipboard' icon üìã), making any edits, and then pasting from there into Python.

We've created a [short video](https://youtu.be/vKVUfU5Iikc) to show how this works.

### GETTING HELP

Although we would like to imagine that all of the exercises in **Code Camp** are so well-explained and well-designed that you'll never have a question or a problem that seems... unlikely.

First, remember that Google is your friend here and saying ‚ÄúI Googled it‚Äù will *never* get you marked down. Review the solutions that Google suggests *first*, but if you're genuinely stuck with a technical problem or conceptual challenge then let us know. You can reach us on [CASA-Code-Camp@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:CASA-Code-Camp@ucl.ac.uk) ‚Äî we can't promise to reply at 3am in the morning, but well do our best to get back to you quickly!

We look forward to seeing you in the Autumn!

Sincerely,

*The Foundations of Spatial Data Science Team*
