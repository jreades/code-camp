Dear Masters Students,

We look forward to meeting you in-person soon!

This is the second (and last!) email intended for those of you who have never programmed before or who have not programmed recently. We want to help you **do better on assessments and get more out of your degree**, so that's why we're letting you know about Code Camp.

### WHAT IS CODE CAMP?

Code Camp is a short introduction to the basics of programming in Python that you take at your own pace. There are no tests, or extra credit for completing Code Camp, but **the more** **you do, the better you will do**. Learning to code is like a learning a language: it's a lot easier if you give yourself time and practice regularly. Starting now.

Code Camp is accessed through a micro-site at: [jreades.github.io/code-camp/](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/)

### RUNNING CODE CAMP

The easiest way to run Code Camp is directly in the browser of your computer, tablet, or phone. So even if your only free time for coding is on a commute, you can get started now: 

1.	Any of the lessons on the [microsite](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/) that involve coding will show a notice that 'Pyodide' is initialising.
2.	Once the status of Pyodide changes to 'Ready' any of the code on that page can be run in your browser just by clicking the 'Play' (â–º) button. 
3.	You can also edit any of the code that you see so that you can experiment and test your understanding.

#### RUNNING LOCALLY

If you don't want to (or can't) run the code in your browser, then you can follow the [Installing Python options](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/setup/install.html) to select an appropriate 'Python distribution'. You will also want a place to save and edit the Python code before you paste it into the Python interpreter. We would suggest [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as it's free and open source. On a Windows machine you can also use Notepad/Notepad++.

#### GETTING HELP

Although we might like to imagine that all of the exercises in Code Camp are so well-explained and well-designed that you'll never have a question or a problem that isn't answered that's... unlikely.

First, remember that Google is your friend here and saying "I Googled it" will never get you marked down. Review the solutions that Google suggests and then you'll have a clearer definition of your problem so that you can ask questions in clear and simple terms.

If you're genuinely stuck with a technical problem or conceptual challenge then let us know. You can reach us on CASA-Code-Camp@ucl.ac.uk - we can't promise to reply at 3am in the morning, but well do our best to get back to you quickly!

We look forward to seeing you in the Autumn!
