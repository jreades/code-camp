In effect, it's common to find Python classes that _import_ a 'base class' and then _extend_ it with additional functionality. \n\nThe two main libraries for working with small to medium-sized data sets in Python are `pandas` and `geopandas`. The creators of `pandas` were't interested in spatial data analysis, so they didn't implement any functionality for reading/writing/analysing spatial data. Along come some developers who *are* interested in spatial problems and `geopandas` as born! But they don't want to have to copy+paste lots of code from `pandas` just to implement the *same* functionality that pandas already provides (calculating the mean, reading an Excel file, handling time series data...) so they *extend* pandas by importing it and adding *only* the new bits that are needed to deal with geography: in this way 'pandas' learns how to work with geodata... \n\n## The 'Tree of Life'\n\nHere's a simple way to think about inheritance: think of the 'evolutionary trees' you might have seen charting the evolution of organisms over time. At the bottom of the tree is the single-celled animal, and at the other end are humans, whales, wildebeest, etc. We all _inherit_ some basic functionality from that original, simple cell. \n\nIn between us and that primitive, however, are a whole series of branches: different bits of the tree evolved in different directions and developed different 'functionality'. Some of us have bones. Some have  cartilege. Some are vegetarian, and some are carnivorous. And so on. \n\nWhen you get to the primates we all share certain common 'features' (binocular vision, grasping hands, etc.), but we are _still_ more similar to gorillas than we are to macaques. So gorillas and humans _extend_ the primitive 'primate functionality' with some bonus features (bigger brains, greater strength, etc.) that are useful, while macaques extend it with a slightly different set of features (tails, etc.).\n\n![Tree of Life](http://palaeos.com/systematics/tree/images/treeolif.jpg)\n\n## The 'Tree of Classes'\n\nInheritance in code works in a similar way: *all* Python classes (lists, pandas, plots, etc.) inherit their most basic functionality from a single primitive 'object' class that itself does very little except to provide a template for what an object should look like. As you move along the inheritance tree you will find more and more complex objects with increasingly advanced features: GeoPandas inherits from Pandas, Bokeh and Seaborn inherit from matplotlib, etc. \n\nI can't find an image of Python base class inheritance, but I've found an equally useful example of how _anything_ can be modelled using this 'family tree' approach... consider the following:\n\n![Vehicle Inheritance](http://www.mkonar.org/dogus/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/python/vehicle.png?w=750&tok=4c7ed7)\n\nIf we were trying to implement a vehicle registration scheme in Python, we would want to start with the most basic category of all: _vehicle_. The vehicle class itself might not do much, but it gives us a template for _all_ vehicles (e.g. it must be registered, it must have a unique license number, etc.). We then _extend_ the functionality of this 'base class' with three intermediate classes: two-wheeled vehicles, cars, and trucks. These, in turn, lead to eight actual vehicle types. These might have _additional_ functionality: a bus might need have a passenger capacity associated with it, while a convertible might need to be hard- or soft-top. All of this could be expressed in Python as:\n\n```python\nclass vehicle(object): # Inherit from base class\n    def __init__(self):\n        ... do something ...\n\nclass car(vehicle): # Inherit from vehicle\n    def __init__(self):\n        ... do other stuff ...\n\nclass sedan(car): # Inherit from car\n    def __init__(self):\n        ... do more stuff ...\n```\n\nThis way, when we create a new `sedan`, it automatically 'knows' about vehicles and cars, and can make use of functions like `set_unique_id(<identification>)` even if that function is _only_ specified in the base vehicle class! The thing to remember is that programmers are _lazy_: if they can avoid reinventing the wheel, they will. Object-Oriented Programming using inheritance is a good example of _constructive_ laziness: it saves us having to constantly copy and paste code (for registering a new vehicle or reading in a CSV file) from one class to the next since we can just import it and _extend_ it! \n\n### Advantages of Inheritance \\#1\n\nThis also means that we are less likely to make mistakes: if we want to update our vehicle registration scheme then we don't need to update lots of functions all over the place, we just update the base class and _all_ inheriting classes automatically gain the update because they are making use of the base class' function. \n\nSo if pandas is updated with a new 'load a zip file' feature then geopandas automatically benefits from it! The _only_ thing that doesn't gain that benefit immediately is our ability to make use of specifically geographical data because pandas doesn't know about that type of data, only 'normal' tabular data.\n\n### Advantages of Inheritance \\#2\n\nInheritance also means that you can always use an instance of a 'more evolved' class in place of one of its ancestors: simplifying things a _bit_, a sedan can automatically do anything that a car can do and, by extension, anything that a vehicle can do. \n\nSimilarly, since geopandas inherits from pandas if you need to use a geopandas object _as if_ it's a pandas object then that will work! So everything you learned last term for pandas can still be used in geopandas. Kind of cool, right?\n\n### Designing for Inheritance\n\nFinally, looking back at our example above: what about unicycles? Or tracked vehicles like a tank? This is where _design_ comes into the picture: when we're planning out a family tree for our work we need to be careful about what goes where. And there isn't always a single right answer: perhaps we should distinguish between pedal-powered and motor-powered (in which case unicycles, bicycles and tricycles all belong in the same family)? Or perhaps we need to distinguish between wheeled and tracked (in which case we're missing a pair of classes [wheeled, tracked] between 'vehicle' and 'two-wheel, car, truck')? These choices are tremendously important but often very hard to get right.\n\nOK, that's enough programming theory, let's see this in action...\n\n## Classes\n\nHere is a simple demonstration of how classes work and why they're useful in programming. Building on last week's 'volume of a sphere' question here's how we'd create and work with a 'shape' class in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import pi\n\nclass shape(object): # Inherit from base class \n    def __init__(self): \n        return \n    \n    def volume(self):\n        raise Exception(\"Unimplmented method error.\")\n    \n    def diameter(self):\n        raise Exception(\"Unimplmented method error.\")\n        \n    def type(self):\n        return(self.shape_type)\n    \nclass cube(shape): # Inherit from shape \n    def __init__(self, e):\n        self.shape_type = 'Cube'\n        self.edge = e\n        return\n    \n    def volume(self):\n        return self.edge**3\n    \n    def diameter(self):\n        return (self.edge**2 + self.edge**2)**(1/2)\n\nclass sphere(shape): # Inherit from shape \n    def __init__(self, r):\n        self.shape_type = 'Sphere'\n        self.radius = r\n        return\n    \n    def volume(self):\n        return (4/3) * pi * self.radius**3\n    \n    def diameter(self):\n        return self.radius*2\n\nclass pyramid(shape): # Inherit from shape\n    \n    has_mummies = True # This is for *all* regular pyramids\n    \n    def __init__(self, e):\n        self.shape_type = 'Regular Pyramid'\n        self.edge   = e\n        return  \n\nclass t_pyramid(pyramid): # Inherit from pyramid (this is a triangular pyramid)\n    \n    has_mummies = False # This is for all triangular pyramids\n    \n    def __init__(self, e):\n        self.shape_type = 'Triangular Pyramid'\n        self.edge   = e\n        return \n    \n    def area(self):\n        return (3**(1/2)/4) * self.edge**2\n    \n    def height(self):\n        # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivF3ndmkMsE\n        return (6**(1/2) * self.edge/3)\n    \n    def volume(self):\n        #  V = 1/3 * A * h\n        return (1/3) * self.area() * self.height()\n\ns = sphere(10)\nprint(s.type())\nprint(\"\\tVolume is: {0:5.2f}\".format(s.volume()))\nprint(\"\\tDiameter is: {0:5.2f}\".format(s.diameter()))\nprint(\"\")\n\nc = cube(10)\nprint(c.type())\nprint(\"\\tVolume is: {0:5.2f}\".format(c.volume()))\nprint(\"\\tDiameter is: {0:5.2f}\".format(c.diameter()))\nprint(\"\")\n\np = t_pyramid(10)\nprint(p.type())\nprint(\"\\tVolume is: {0:5.2f}\".format(p.volume()))\nif p.has_mummies is True:\n    print(\"\\tMummies? Aaaaaaaaagh!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\tPhew, no mummies!\")\n\n# The error here is deliberate -- note that diameter\n# is not implemented in either triangular pyramid, pyramid, \n# or shape, only for spheres.\nprint(\"\\tDiameter is: {0:5.2f}\".format(p.diameter()))\nprint(\"\")\n```\n\n**Have a really good think about how this kind of behaviour is useful!**\n\n### Test Your Understanding \n\nBased on the above examples of classes and methods, I have two challenges for you to implement in the code below:\n\n1. Try fully-implementing the *regular* pyramid class with a square base that we skipped over above!\n2. Try adding an `area` method that returns the surface area of each shape and then add that information to the output below.\n\n```python\nfrom math import pi\n\nclass shape(object): # Inherit from base class \n    def __init__(self): \n        return \n    \n    def volume(self):\n        raise Exception(\"Unimplmented method error.\")\n    \n    def diameter(self):\n        raise Exception(\"Unimplmented method error.\")\n        \n    def type(self):\n        return(self.shape_type)\n    \nclass cube(shape): # Inherit from shape \n    def __init__(self, e):\n        self.shape_type = 'Cube'\n        self.edge = e\n        return\n    \n    def volume(self):\n        return self.edge**3\n    \n    def diameter(self):\n        return (self.edge**2 + self.edge**2)**(1/2)\n\nclass sphere(shape): # Inherit from shape \n    def __init__(self, r):\n        self.shape_type = 'Sphere'\n        self.radius = r\n        return\n    \n    def volume(self):\n        return (4/3) * pi * self.radius**3\n    \n    def diameter(self):\n        return self.radius*2\n\nclass pyramid(shape): # Inherit from shape\n    \n    has_mummies = True # This is for *all* regular pyramids\n    \n    def __init__(self, e):\n        self.shape_type = 'Regular Pyramid'\n        self.edge   = e\n        return  \n\nclass t_pyramid(pyramid): # Inherit from pyramid (this is a triangular pyramid)\n    \n    has_mummies = False # This is for all triangular pyramids\n    \n    def __init__(self, e):\n        self.shape_type = 'Triangular Pyramid'\n        self.edge   = e\n        return \n    \n    def area(self):\n        return (3**(1/2)/4) * self.edge**2\n    \n    def height(self):\n        # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivF3ndmkMsE\n        return (6**(1/2) * self.edge/3)\n    \n    def volume(self):\n        #  V = 1/3 * A * h\n        return (1/3) * self.area() * self.height()\n\n# How would you test these changes?\n```\n\n### Credits!\n\n#### Contributors:\nThe following individuals have contributed to these teaching materials: \n- [James Millington](https://github.com/jamesdamillington)\n- [Jon Reades](https://github.com/jreades)\n\n#### License\nThe content and structure of this teaching project itself is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), and the contributing source code is licensed under [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n\n#### Acknowledgements:\nSupported by the [Royal Geographical Society](https://www.rgs.org/HomePage.htm) (with the Institute of British Geographers) with a Ray Y Gildea Jr Award.\n\n#### Potential Dependencies:\nThis lesson may depend on the following libraries: None\n\n",
