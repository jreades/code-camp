    "\n",
    "**A**: Because it keeps our code 'clean' and allows us to have functions with the *same name* that do different things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to write a program to read data from two different web sites (_e.g._ [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/default.asp) and the [London Data Store](https://data.london.gov.uk/)) \n",
    "- It turns out that both already have handy Python packages that help you to read the data if you give them the URL of the page to read\n",
    "- Even better, *both* packages have a simple function called `read_data(...)` that takes a URL and extracts the data that you want from that page as a CSV file, except...\n",
    "- Because the web sites are _completely_ different the `read_data(...)` functions are _specific_ to that one web site!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if both packages have functions callend `read_data()`, then after you have done:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nomis_reader\n",
    "import ldn_data_store_reader\n",
    "```\n",
    "How does Python know which `read_data` you want to use? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is the _namespace_: you can _only_ access the NOMIS `read_data` function by typing `nomis.read_data(...)` and you can _only_ access the Data Store `read_data` function by typing `ldn_data_store_reader.read_data(...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Import... As...\n",

    "The length and awkwardness of that last line is why you can write this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import ldn_data_store_reader as ldn\n",

    "When you're tackling a programming problem you break it down into separate, simpler steps, and then tick them off one by one.

To simplify things a great deal: the computer really just needs to know the location of the file and an appropriate _protocol_ for accessing that file (_e.g._ http, https, ftp, local...) and then a clever programming language like Python will typically have packages that can kind of take of the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases -- local and remote -- you use the package to handle the hard bit of knowing how to actually 'read' data (because all files are just `1`s and `0`s of data) at the _device_ level and then Python gives you back a 'file handle' that helps you to achieve things like 'read a line' or 'close an open file'. You can think of a filehandle as something that gives you a 'grip' on a file-like object no matter where or what it is, and the package is the way that this magic is achieved."
