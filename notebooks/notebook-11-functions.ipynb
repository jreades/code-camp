The idea is to avoid \"wasting time re-inventing the wheel\" and programmers have abbreviated this idea to the acronym **D.R.Y.** (Do not Repeat Yourself): if you are doing something more than once or twice, ask yourself if there's a way to encapsulate what you are doing in a function: you write the function _once_, and then _call_ it whenever you need to complete that task."

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    for i in range(inputRange):\n",

    "            print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This defines a new function called `oddNumbers` which takes one parameter – it's not immediately clear what type of variable `inputRange` is, but we can guess it pretty quickly from what happens next.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there's are some lines immediately _after_ the function definition (between the triple-quotes) that aren't printed or obviously used, but that look like documentation of some sort. We'll come back to that in a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line is a simple `for` loop: `for i in range(inputRange)`. The `range` function [generates](https://www.pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/) a list of numbers from 0 to the input parameter passed to it. So we are going to be running a loop from 0 to *n* (where *n*=`inputRange`) and assigning the result of that to `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line is nested inside the for loop: so we take _each_ `i` in turn and perform the modulo calculation on it: if `i%2` is `0` then `i` is divisble by 2. It's even. If it's not equal to `0` then it's not an even number, and in that case we'll print it out.\n",
