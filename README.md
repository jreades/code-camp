# Code Camp [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3474043.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3474043)

An on-line coding primer for Python originally produced by [King's College London's Department of Geography](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/geography) and (this version) now maintained and developed by the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa) (CASA) at UCL.

### Purpose

Welcome! This repository seeks to teach you the basics of how to code in Python. Our focus is on simple examples that (we hope) speak to students who are _not_ Computer Scientists by training. Perhaps you dabbled a bit in High School? Perhaps you've never done any programming *ever*? Whatever, we're here to help!

### Setting Up

There are two main ways to run [set up the coding environment](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/setup/), one of which doesn't require you to instal anything at all!

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will have a basic understanding of:

- The rationale behind the usage of computers and computational methodologies
- The way computers "think" and "work"
- How computers programs are structured and how to execute them
- The fundamental concepts of programming (in Python) such as the concept of `variable`, `iteration`, `list`, `object`, `loop`, `function` etc.,  etc.
- How your newly acquired coding skills can help you be _effectively lazy_.
