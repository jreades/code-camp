title: "No Install Options"
---

The following options will allow you to run Python code without installing _anything_ at all on your computer. You will be running code 'in the cloud' and so need an internet-connected device to write and run code. Also, your code may not be saved if you log out or don't run any code for a long period of time.

## Google Colab

Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?) will require a Google login, but offers a few benefits: you can save your code, search for other 'notebooks' (the way you will run code), and add notebooks from [GitHub](https://github.com) where Code Camp is saved. As long as you don't mind having a Google account, it's probably the best way to get started.

## Binder

[MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/) works in a similar way to Colab, but no login is required and you can only use the notebooks from our GitHub repository. You'll also lose your notebooks when you log out/don't run any code for a while _unless_ you download and save the notebook on your computer first.

### Recommendation

We'd recommend Google Colab on the basis that you can save your work.

### Action

Here's a short video showing the process for Google Colab. We've assumed that you already have a Google account, if not you'll need to set one up first:
