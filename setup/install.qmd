title: "Installing Python"
---

Installing Python or R is fairly straightforward nowdays, but be warned: what you will see _after_ installing them ain't pretty. By default, Python and R code is simply the black-and-white text output of an 'interpreter' (something that processes lines of code by 'interpreting' our code into instructions to the computer, and back). People who code all the time will _always_ install an [IDE](../lessons/Tools_of_the_Trade.qmd) like RStudio or VSCode because it 'prettifies' the code that they run, making it easier to spot mistakes and track links between files containing code that interact. 

You can complete a _lot_ of Code Camp using just the basic Python interpreter, but you might find it _easier_ to look at the [no install options](./no_install.qmd) since these automatically include tools for beautifying your Python code. However, if you're sure that you want to install Python on your computer then here's what you do... 

## 'System' Python

Many computers (especially Macs and Linux systems) will come with Python pre-installed. To find out if you have Python installed:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Mac

Open up the Terminal (under `Applications` > `Utilities`) and then type `python --version ↩︎`.

### Windows 

Open the Command Prompt  (either run `cmd.exe` or search for `Command Prompt` from the Windows menu) and then type `python --version ↩︎`.

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
`↩︎` means hit `Enter` or `Return` on your keyboard. **Don't** try to paste the symbol into the Terminal or Command Prompt.
:::

In both cases, if Python is already installed then you will see something like the following (your exact version may differ):

```bash
Python 3.8.16
```

If you see this kind output then, congratulations, you have Python installed!

## Versions

Don't worry too much about what version of Python you see listed (in the example above it's 3.8.16) as long as you have _at least_ verion 3.8.0. You should _not_ use Python2 (e.g. 2.7.6) or versions of Python3 earlier than 3.6.

## 'Reference' Python

The 'reference' version of Python is the one produced by the Python Software Foundation. Whatever operating system you're using, you should start from the [downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions from there. You will want a **Stable Release**, _not_ a Pre-release version of Python.

Once it's installed, you just use the Terminal or Command Prompt as above.

### Our Recommendation

You would need to have 'Reference' Python installed anyway to [make the most of QGIS](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/351290/62754), so we'd use that one. And getting used to the Terminal/Command Prompt is no bad thing since you'll be using it a lot in the future.
