# Base Utilities

In order to access the majority of the features that this module uses, you will need to install several 'base' utilities:

## MacOS

You will need to install the following:

1. The Xcode Command Line Tools, which can usually be installed [directly from the Terminal](https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/). If that does not work for you, then you can use the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) to download and install manually. *Note*: this may require you to get a free developer account.
2. Although not strictly necessary, you'll *eventually* want the Homebrew package manager, which can also be installed [directly from the Terminal](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-homebrew-on-mac). 

## Windows

You will need to install the following:

1. WSL 2, for which you can follow [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10).
