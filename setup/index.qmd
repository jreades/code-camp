title: "Getting Started"

We've tried to keep Code Camp as simple as possible so that you can get started as quickly as possible. We will present you with some _options_ (and some _recommendations_), but it's up to you to choose the option that feels most natural to you.

## Prerequisites

Beyond finding a way to run Python code (see below), there are _no_ requirements or prerequisites for Code Camp. However, you might find it useful to complete the basic computer [health check](./health.qmd); that page also includes some *recommendations* if you are considering buying a new computer any time soon.

## Running Python

We *recommend* that you simply run [Code Camp in your browser](./no_install.qmd) since that will allow you to learn (and run) Python anywhere and any time. However, you are welcome to run Code Camp code on your own computer (see: [install options](./install.qmd)).
